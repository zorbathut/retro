Realized I really hate TODO files, and with a project with apparently no outside interest,
they're relatively pointless. (actually, I realized this a few weeks ago, I was just too lazy to
mention it.)

Added descriptions for everything else
Added a system so the file manager no longer ticks on every wrapped, only the ones that need
CPU power
Changed semantics - request now increments the allocation count (meaning that it is no longer
a no-op, it's equivalent to a delayed activate)
Removed idletime deallocation - deallocation now happens immediately. This is a result of the
semantics change, which is a result of the tick-only-on-necessary - idletime could be readded.
Improved logging for allocation systems.

8/3/01
changed the TIMESPACE #ifdef/#ifndefs to RETRO. (TIMESPACE is the name of the game I was
planning to write, before I made the library standalone.)
Added module descriptions
