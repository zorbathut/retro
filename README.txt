This project is currently meant to be compiled with Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0. I haven't tested it with gcc yet. I shall, trust me! but not yet :) If you want to, try it out and let me know what would be needed to fix it. I *really* want to hear from anyone who gets this! Any comments at all, including "the file layout looked messy so I decided to ignore it" would be appreciated. Lob off an email to zorbathut@sourceforge.net or post a comment somewhere on http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/retro. At this moment, I'll reply to anything anyone sends me, just because, well, nobody's sent me anything ;.;
